*** PaperWallet-PIB ***

This project is a fork of github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet
which is a fork of github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org , the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This attractive paper wallet design is one-sided and folds up to
hide the private key.

This generator takes as input the private keys generated by github.com/antonio-fr/SGenAdr.

Public addresses are timelocked (CLTV-P2KSH) until January 1st 2018 CET.


*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file or get from git clone
2) Copy PvKeysList.json generated from SGenAdr in this dir
3) Open up the 'genwallets.html' file with your web browser.
4) Move your mouse
5) Click on 'Paper Wallet'
6) Adjust 'Addresses to generate' accordingly
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Firefox or Chrome
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will produce corrupted/illegible keys.


*** COMPARED WITH BITADDRESS.ORG ***

Images and resources have been moved out of the .html file (where they were
base-64 encoded) and into an images directory to make the code easier to review.

All cryptographic functions are verifiably identical to those in bitaddress.org.
(Run a "diff" between this project and bitaddress.org if you want to be sure.)

Now Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently 
generated in a web browser.

The bitaddress.org project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded. 

Here is a link to the BitcoinTalk.org forum topic discussing this project:

END USER NOTES: 
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and 
    Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
